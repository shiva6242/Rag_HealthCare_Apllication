Patient Care Guidelines

Patient care focuses on improving health outcomes through accurate diagnosis,
timely treatment, and compassionate support.

Basic Patient Care:
Healthcare providers must ensure patient comfort, hygiene, and emotional well-being.
Vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and oxygen levels
must be monitored regularly.

Chronic Disease Management:
Patients with chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and asthma require
continuous monitoring and long-term care plans. Lifestyle modifications such as
diet control, exercise, and medication adherence are critical.

Elderly Patient Care:
Elderly patients may require assistance with mobility, nutrition, and medication.
Fall prevention strategies and regular cognitive assessments are recommended.

Emergency Care:
Emergency patients must be stabilized immediately. Life-saving interventions
take priority over administrative procedures.

Patient Education:
Patients should be educated about their conditions, treatment plans,
possible side effects, and preventive measures to reduce future risks.
